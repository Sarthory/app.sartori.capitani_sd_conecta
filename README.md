# GitHub Users Search Application

# App Features

## By typing a username/login, this app consumes GitHub REST API then inflates the screen with users data (in case there's any) in form of cards.

## You can visit a seleted user profile on GitHub too.

##### I would like to make it clear that tests are not one of my strongest pillars, as I have participated in numerous projects and so far none of them had a testing culture, but I am super willing to learn and improve the little I know about testing! You can count on me! ðŸ˜ƒ
